# Project Title

Automatic Detecting and counting endangered colonial breeding terns using machine learning methods

## Description
In this project, we developed a fully automated deep-learning-based algorithm to identify, count, and map breeding seabirds, focusing on two tern species in Israel: the vulnerable Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) and the endangered Little Tern (Sternula albifrons) in a challenging environment, in a large and densely populated breeding colony containing breeding pairs of two visually similar species. Using YOLOv8 for initial object detection, we enhanced classification performance by integrating ecological and behavioral features, including spatial fidelity, movement patterns, and size through camera calibration techniques.
For a detailed description of the methods and results, please refer to our paper.

## Mapping Camera Positions to Real-World Coordinates
We setup preset camera positions with specific zoom, yaw and pitch settings, enabling automated scanning tours at predefined intervals and times between the present positions location. 
Automated scans were conducted multiple times daily. Each camera focused on its designated area, with combined coverage of the entire island.  
The cameras were calibrated using a drone image of the colony anchored to geographic coordinates. By utilizing the drone image along with recorded zoom levels, pitch, and yaw for each frame, we calculated the precise location of each pixel on the island. This calibration allowed us to convert pixel dimensions into centimeters, enabling the actual size of each bounding box to be calculated and incorporated as a feature in the classifier.  
In this section, we describe the code parts that facilitate to map the camera positions into real-world coordinates.

### Fetch camera positions PTZ parameters
We use Python script (get_camera_ptz.py) to fetch the preset position PTZ parameters (zoom, pitch, and yaw) of the camera. The script should be executed while the scan is triggered and uses Dahua camera external API to fetch details. 

#### Script usage
1. Navigate to the RealCoordinatesCalculator directory.
2. Specify camera details in get_camera_ptz.ini.
3. Run get_camera_ptz.py script with argument of delay (in seconds) between position change. 
```bash
Python get_camera_ptz.py -s 15
```
* The script should be executed while the scan is triggered.

The script saves all PTZ details in a text file.


### Camera PTZ adjusments
In draw_ptz_on_drone.ipynb Notebook, we calibrate the camera to map positions into the real-world coordinates. We made small adjustments to the values based on deviations observed in the positions mapping on the island area. The notebook visualizes all positions' areas on drone image. We recommend visualizing all the flags in the drone image and making adjustments if needed (by comparing them to images from the cameras' flags) at the beginning of each season, as we observed small changes in flag locations from year to year.

### Detecting Overlaps Between Position Areas
The detect_overlaps.ipynb notebook identifies overlaps between camera positions to prevent multiple counts of the same tern from different camera positions.  
The script saves all redundant areas in a JSON file (overlap_areas.json), which is used later when counting terns.


## Models training process

### Training YOLOv8 for Species Detection
We fine-tuned a YOLOv8 model to distinguish between Common Terns and Little Terns based on their physical characteristics. 
A Jupyter Notebook (training_YOLOv8.ipynb) is provided to facilitate training using Ultralytics' YOLOv8. The training command is executed within the notebook to fine-tune the model on our dataset. 
The dataset was organized and splitted using the Roboflow platform. You can find it here: universe.roboflow.com/eyal-halabi-nx8bs/terns-detection-3.0/dataset/3

#### Notebook Usage
1. Navigate to the YoloDetector directory.
2. Open the training_YOLOv8.ipynb notebook.
3. Specify the training settings, including the Terns dataset path (YAML format).
4. Run all cells to start training the model.

The trained model weights and logs are saved in the project output path defined in the Notebook.

### Training final classifier model to determine species
We create a range of features that represent the track of the tagged tern. These features include integrated outputs from the YOLOv8 model, movement rate and detection rate, location probability and box dimensions in centimers.

1. Run steps 1 to 3 from 'Running the Algorithm on specific date' section on the videos of scans where the tagged images were captured. These steps create tern tracks.
2. Navigate to TrainingModel directory.
3. Specify setting parameters in train_classifier.ini.
4. Open train_classifier.ipynb Notebook.
5. Run all cells.

This process associates tracks to the tagged terns and after that creates all features that represents tracks. The notebook trains and evaluates performance on multiple classifier models and saves the best-performing model.
